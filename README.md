# Singular Value Decomposition and Image Compression

## üéØ Project Mission & My Role
This project was a deep dive into one of the most powerful algorithms in numerical linear algebra: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Our mission, as part of the "Numerical Linear Algebra" course at Politecnico di Milano, was to move beyond theory and implement a practical, high-performance solution for a real-world application: image compression and denoising.

As the project lead, my role was to guide our team's strategy and ensure we built a robust and well-documented solution. I focused on architecting the overall workflow, from loading and processing images using the C++ Eigen library to comparing iterative solvers with the LIS library.

This README serves as a comprehensive technical report of our findings, demonstrating a first-principles understanding of SVD and its profound applications in high-performance scientific computing.

## 1. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

Singular Value Decomposition is a fundamental technique in linear algebra that factorizes a matrix into three matrices: U, Œ£, and V^T. For any m √ó n matrix A:

A = UŒ£V^T

Where:
- U is an m √ó m orthogonal matrix
- Œ£ is an m √ó n rectangular diagonal matrix with nonnegative real numbers on the diagonal
- V^T is the transpose of an n √ó n orthogonal matrix

SVD has numerous applications, including image compression and noise reduction.

## 2. Image Compression Using SVD

SVD can be used for image compression by approximating the original matrix with a lower-rank matrix. This is done by keeping only the k largest singular values and their corresponding singular vectors:

A ‚âà œÉ‚ÇÅu‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ^T + œÉ‚ÇÇu‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ^T + ... + œÉ‚Çñu‚Çñv‚Çñ^T

Where œÉ·µ¢ are singular values, u·µ¢ are left singular vectors, and v·µ¢ are right singular vectors.

### Example: 4x4 Image Matrix

Let's walk through a simple example of SVD-based image compression using a 4x4 grayscale image matrix.

#### Step 1: Original Image Matrix A
```
A = [100  120  130  115]
    [105  125  135  120]
    [110  130  140  125]
    [115  135  145  130]
```

#### Step 2: Compute SVD
After computing SVD, we get U, Œ£, and V^T matrices.

#### Step 3: Truncate SVD
For compression, we keep only the first k singular values and vectors. Let's say k = 2.

#### Step 4: Reconstruct Compressed Image
The compressed image is reconstructed using only the first two components:

A' ‚âà œÉ‚ÇÅu‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ^T + œÉ‚ÇÇu‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ^T

#### Step 5: Resulting Compressed Image Matrix
```
A' ‚âà [99   119  131  116]
     [104  124  136  121]
     [110  130  141  126]
     [115  135  146  131]
```

This compressed version approximates the original image while using less data.

## 3. Why Numerical Linear Algebra?

SVD and image processing involve complex matrix operations, making efficient numerical methods crucial. **Numerical linear algebra** provides the tools to perform these operations effectively. In this project, we use:

- **Eigen Library**: For matrix operations and SVD computation
- **LIS Library**: For iterative solvers in eigenvalue problems

---

## 4. C++ Implementation with Eigen and LIS

We use the **Eigen** and **LIS** libraries for matrix manipulation, SVD computation, and solving linear systems. Here's an overview of the key libraries and headers used:

```cpp
#include <Eigen/IterativeLinearSolvers> 
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <tuple>
#include <utility>
#include <algorithm>
#include <fstream>
#include <cstdio>
#include <memory>
#include <stdexcept>
#include <string>
#include <cmath>
#include <array>
```
